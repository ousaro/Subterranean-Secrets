# Subterranean-Secrets

This project is a demonstration of my journey in learning Unity and its various components. It represents my exploration of game development concepts, including scripting, design patterns, built-in Unity functionalities, and multiple aspects of game mechanics.

---

## Project Overview

This project serves as a **learning tool** where I focused on understanding and implementing:

- Unity **components** and their functionalities.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Unity scripting.
- The **Singleton pattern** for managing the player.
- Unity's **built-in functions** and their **order of execution**.
- Core aspects of game development:
  - **UI** implementation.
  - **Audio** integration.
  - **Animation** for characters and environment.

## Key Features

1. **Player Management:**
   - Utilized the **Singleton pattern** to ensure a single instance of the player.
   - Handled player states and behaviors effectively using OOP principles.

2. **Built-In Unity Functions:**
   - Explored Unity's built-in methods such as `Start()`, `Update()`, `FixedUpdate()`, and more.
   - Gained an understanding of their execution order and how to use them efficiently in scripting.

3. **UI Development:**
   - Created and managed **menus**, **health bars**, and **other UI elements**.
   - Learned how to interact with UI through scripts.

4. **Audio Integration:**
   - Implemented background music and sound effects.
   - Learned to control audio settings dynamically during gameplay.

5. **Animations:**
   - Created and managed animations for characters and environment elements using Unity's Animation system.
   - Explored transitions and triggers within the Animator component.

## What I Learned

1. **Unity Basics:**
   - Understanding and applying Unity components like **Transform**, **Rigidbody**, and **Collider**.
   - Managing scenes and navigating the Unity Editor.

2. **Scripting:**
   - Writing scripts in **C#** to manage game logic and interactions.
   - Implementing OOP principles.

3. **Design Patterns:**
   - Using the **Singleton pattern** for centralized game state and player management.

4. **Game Development Pipeline:**
   - Tackling multiple aspects of game development, including **UI**, **audio**, and **animation**.
   - Testing and debugging to ensure smooth gameplay.
